![Design preview for the Crowdfunding product page coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

This project represents my solution for the Crowdfunding Product Page challenge provided by [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/). The challenge aimed to create a visually appealing and interactive product page for a crowdfunding campaign, showcasing the product details and providing functionality for users to make pledges.

## Overview

The Crowdfunding Product Page challenge focused on building an engaging and informative page that effectively presents a crowdfunding campaign for a product. The goal was to create a design that captures attention, communicates the product details, and encourages users to support the campaign through pledges.

Throughout the project, I strived to understand the design requirements and implemented a responsive layout using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SCSS. The objective was to create a visually appealing and interactive product page that adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes and devices.

By leveraging CSS and SCSS techniques, I aimed to enhance the design with attention to detail, ensuring a visually consistent and appealing experience. The use of color schemes, typography, and imagery played a crucial role in creating an immersive and persuasive visual presentation.

Additionally, JavaScript was utilized to implement interactivity on the page, such as updating pledge progress, enabling pledge options, and displaying modal windows for user interactions.
